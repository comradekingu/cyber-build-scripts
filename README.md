# Cyber Build Scripts
These are my build scripts for [CyberOS](https://github.com/cyberos).

## Quick note
Just like Cyber, these scripts are meant to be ran under Arch. Other distros **will not** be supported.

## How to use
Clone and run `./install-all.sh` in the root of the repo. Make sure you have `base-devel` (you should if you're already building AUR packages.)
