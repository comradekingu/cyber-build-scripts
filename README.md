# Cyber Build Scripts
This repository contains PKGBUILDs used by the [CyberOS Build System](https://ci.omame.tech/).

They will let you install Cyber on top of any Arch-based distro with a script for convenience.

## Quick note
Just like Cyber, these PKGBUILDs are meant to be ran under Arch/CyberOS.

Other distros may work, however we will not provide support for them.

## How to use
Clone and run `./install-all.sh` in the root of the repo as a user with sudo permissions.

Make sure you have `base-devel` (you should if you're already building AUR packages.)
